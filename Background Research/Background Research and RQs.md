## The Client's Organization and its Mission and Goals
Our Project is based on the Homestead National Monument Water Quality Monitoring. In this section, we will talk about the Organization, the associated history and their Mission and Goals.

### Introduction

Homestead National Monument of America (HOME) is a unit of National Park Service. [1]
The National Monument first began part of the National Register of Historic places in the year 1966. [1]
The National Monument 5 miles west of Beatrice, Gage County, and Nebraska. This site is now one among the most successfully claimed acres claimed under the Homestead Act. [1]

HOME allowed qualified people to claim up to 160 acres of land owned by the federal government in exchange for five years of residence, cultivation and improving the property in every possible way. [1] Because of this act, approximately 270 million or 10% of total area of the United States was claimed and settled under this Act. This led to drastic changes in the land which was eventually needed. [3]
The Homestead National Monument has a heritage center inside the park where visitors can learn more about the act and the organization by taking a tour of the interactive museum of American homesteading. [1]

Homestead Act holds one of the greater significances for the westward expansion of the United States. It allowed a fair chance to any mankind to claim land for free in exchange for taking care of it keeping it free from contamination, persuading people to take the best care of it. [3]

The Homestead Act brought far-reaching effects on the landscape and in the lives of the people.

To raise concerns regarding water quality HOME monitored aquatic invertebrates which started in the year 1996. The quality of the water was measured against the following factors: -
temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, turbidity, nitrate-nitrogen, total phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria (Escherichia coli). Most of the factors met the standards. However, few of the factors like phosphorus concentrations, turbidity, and fecal coliform bacteria were found to be very high. Summary data showing metric for phosphorus concentrations, turbidity, and fecal coliform bacteria, indicated that the water quality is not appropriate and not biologically supported. Thereby, HOME decided to protect and manage the in-stream habitats. [2]
	
### History and Mission

Homestead Act has been one of the most important legislation in the United States. The very first Homestead was claimed in Brownville, Nebraska by a resident of Ohio name Daniel Freeman in the year 1863. He is the first homesteader in the nation. Daniel served more than 1000 acres and became one of the prominent residents of Gage County. He proposed the idea of memorizing the place he lived in, on his name. Soon after his death, the residents of Beatrice started the agenda of preserving his homestead as National park. Initially, the proposal got rejected by the officials but in the year 1934, the resident of Beatrice organized National Homestead Park Association to continue the deed as performed by The Daniel. [1]

The Association could not do much due to funds issue and soon after America entered World War II the park visitation and development was suspended. [1]

However, in the year 1950, the national park service (NPS) acquired the park and built the visitor center. Gradually there was some positive progress towards the development and in the year 1981, the National Monument had five permanent employees, one part-time and a few seasonal employees. [1]

In the 1970s and 1980s seasonal rangers demonstrated the history of the Homestead Act. By the early 1990s, the Homestead Act began to move to other states in the country. [1]

For an individual to be a homesteader the minimum age limit was 21 years to claim 160 acres of land. Settlers from different places including newly arrived immigrants, farmers without land of their own from the East, single women and formerly enslaved people worked to meet the challenge of "proving up" and keeping this "free land" and preserving it to its best for future. Each homesteader had lived on the land, built their home, making all the improvements and farming for 5 years before they were eligible to meet up the challenge "prove up". A filing fee of $18 was the only money required but sacrifice and hard work extracted a lot more price than was invested. [2]

The Homestead Act remained in effect until 1976, with provisions for homesteading in Alaska until 1986. Alaska was one of the last places in the country where homesteading remained an option for homesteaders till late 1900s. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 substantially caused decrease in the amount of land available to homesteaders in the West. Because of which, successful Homestead claims dropped sharply after late 1990’s. [2]

The Homestead Act of 1862 is recognized as one of the most revolutionary concepts for distributing public land in American history.  [2]
The mission of the organization is to protect and preserve the cultural and natural resources of the National Park System. They also believe that it is our responsibility to protect the resources we have today for the next generation. The services extend with other collaborative partners to conserve the natural and cultural resources and recreating outdoor across the country. [2]
 

### Goals

The goal of the entire Homestead Act is providing free land to people in exchange for asking them to cultivate the land to its best. This agenda helped both mankind and the resources around us. People received land for free to live in and at the same time our natural resources, our land, and water habitats were protected from further contamination. So many families and immigrants flooded more than 10 percent of the land in the US to achieve the ultimate Homestead goal and fulfill the American dream. The goal is to achieve a diverse settlement, agricultural benefits and huge advancement in the field of agriculture. Building nature, renewing our resources to the best for mankind and future generations to live in. [3]

To address concerns about water quality for the sites in Homestead National Monument of America (HOME), the team started monitoring the quality of water against various factors. Most quality measurements met state standards and were found to be generally consistent and typical for the streams belonging to the region. However, there were some measurements that exceeded the acceptance level. The main goal of this was to monitor the water quality and deduce what factors are affecting the water quality of the targeted site. Also, the measures that could be undertaken to address the problems affecting the quality of the streams of the targeted sites. [2]

## The Study Organism and Phenomenon
Water is essential to all life on Earth. In fact, “about 71 percent of the Earth's surface is water-covered, and the oceans hold about 96.5 percent of all Earth's water” [4]. However, freshwater only contributes to a tiny fraction of that amount. Additionally, freshwater supports most living things on Earth which makes it extremely important to keep the source of life safe and clean.

In 1972, the U.S. government introduced the Clean Water Act (CWA) to conserve the quality of surface water. This act was introduced to make sure that all sources of surface water like lakes, streams, and rivers are regulated. From this point onward, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the water quality standards and requirements. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, “the CWA made it unlawful to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless a permit was obtained” [5]. For instance, the EPA set the threshold for the acceptable amount of pollutants and wastewater standards for the industry.

Acknowledge the importance of water quality, many park rangers and water quality professionals have been monitoring the quality of surface water throughout the country. By monitoring water quality, the researchers can identify specific contaminations, trends, and whether the water meets EPA standards. To identify contaminations, the researchers need to look at various chemical constituents like phosphorus, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen. Some of the common factors that lead to water pollution are “the number of people living in a watershed, how the land is used (agriculture, forested, urbanized, etc.) and the everyday behavior of the population” [6]. Also, the researchers need to look at some other components like the streamflow, temperature, pH level, turbidity, total solids, conductivity, total alkalinity, and Fecal bacteria. The combinations of all these measurements help pinpoint the source of the contamination. For instance, if the source of the contamination is from industrial discharge, the researchers can expect to have unusual measurements on the temperature, the conductivity, the total solids, the toxics, and the pH level. In general, the water temperature from upstream to downstream shouldn’t change too drastically so it would be a good signal to let the researchers know that the water might be contaminated.

The flow of a surface water stream has high impacts on the living organisms and inhabitants. To illustrate, a big water stream with a high discharge rate will have more capacity to dilute wastewater than a small water stream with a low discharge rate. Moreover, by studying the flow of a stream, the researchers will be able to identify the kinds of living organisms live in that stream. To measure the streamflow is to calculate the movement of water over a specific area over a set time.

Besides water, oxygen is another important element that supports all life on Earth. However, unlike photosynthesis, water produces and consumes oxygen in its unique way. For example, a water stream will gain oxygen from the surrounding environment and dissolve through various chemical reactions that utilize oxygen. Furthermore, “dissolved oxygen (DO) is important to the health of aquatic ecosystems, as all aquatic animals need oxygen for respiration” [6]. By measuring dissolved oxygen, the researchers can predict the trend of migration from living organisms when the dissolved oxygen levels are low. Other variables, such as temperature has a direct impact on the dissolved oxygen level since hot water holds less oxygen than cold water.

Like dissolved oxygen, the temperature has a huge effect on the aquatic habitats. To give an example, “water temperature influences the rate of plant photosynthesis, the timing of reproduction and migration, and the metabolic rates of aquatic organisms” [6]. Some aquatic organisms like trout and salmon prefer lower water temperature, therefore, an increase in water temperature would likely lead to a lower population of those organisms. Many factors can cause temperature change include weather, industrial wastewater discharges, sewage water, and the dimensions of the stream.

Like temperature, pH level and total alkalinity link to the rate of biological and chemical processes. Moreover, “pH is a measure of how acidic or basic (alkaline) a solution is” [6]. The appropriate pH level for most aquatic organisms is ranging from 6.5 to 8.0. With a low pH level, the water stream becomes acidic which will produce a toxic environment to aquatic organisms. The sources of contamination can come from many sources like acid rain, mineral rocks, or industrial water discharges. With total alkalinity, it is the measurement of how the water stream can tolerate acids. Therefore, by measuring the total alkalinity, the researchers can identify the degree in which a water stream can handle acid inputs and its potential to neutralize acidic contaminations.

Turbidity is another measurement of water quality which focusing on the clarity of the water stream. By looking at the material suspended in water like “soil particles (clay, silt, and sand), algae, plankton, microbes, and other substances” [7], the researchers can monitor the amount of light that goes through the water hence recognize the water turbidity. Not only that “higher turbidity increases water temperatures because suspended particles absorb more heat” [7] but it can ultimately lower the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water stream.

Other chemical elements that have a huge impact on water quality are phosphorus and nitrogen. In addition, “both phosphorus and nitrogen are essential nutrients for the plants and animals that make up the aquatic food web” [7]. Therefore, an increase in phosphorus and nitrates would offset the natural balance by boosting the growth of plant and algae which in terms will lower the dissolved oxygen. By monitoring the phosphorus and nitrates levels, the researchers will be able to foresee the disturbance of the natural balance.

Another way to monitor water quality is to measure the conductivity of the water stream. To do so, the researchers need to test the ability of water to conduct electricity by looking at the presence of inorganic dissolved solids “such as chloride, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate anions (ions that carry a negative charge) or sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, and aluminum cations (ions that carry a positive charge)”[7] and organic compounds like (oil, alcohol, phenol, and sugar). Moreover, if the water stream is contaminated with oil or phenol, the water conductivity will be lower since these organic compounds are not great at conducting electrical current.

Finally, the researchers need to look at fecal bacteria since they are present in mammal feces which means it will be a good indicator for sewage contamination. This type of contamination has a huge impact on human health risk if not resolve quickly. The sources of fecal bacteria can come from “wastewater treatment plants, on-site septic systems, domestic and wild animal manure, and storm runoff” [7]. By looking at fecal bacteria, the researchers will be able to identify if the water stream is safe for humans to interact.

## The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support

The cub creek water quality not only impacts the aquatic species but also the human.  Poor quality of water always affects the nearby land which is used for agricultural productions of corn, soybeans, wheat, and alfalfa. Nowadays water quality is degrading due to many reasons. One of the main reason is Escherichia coli (abbreviated as E. coli) which is a bacteria normally live in the intestines of human and animal. E. coli can get in the water in many ways for example through sewage, rainwater, industrial wastage, etc. These bacteria cannot be seen by open eyes and with the use of microscope only we can see it. The cub creek is connected to a large Tuttle creek water which contains three-fourths drainage of Nebraska. The Tuttle creek lake water flows towards the Kansas river and this river provides public drinking water to the city. That’s the main reason we are evaluating water quality before the problems become bigger. Our first two research questions are related to this concern.

 * Does season or temperature affect the amount of E.coli? (Winter vs. summer?)
 * Does precipitation affect the amount of E.coli? (Sewage water?)

Cub creek collects water from many sources e.g.- rainwater. In a basic/normal water, pH value should be pH>7. But, in acidic water pH value is pH<7. This is also an important measurement in water quality as it determines the solubility and biological availability of chemicals. Aquatic life depends on the pH value. They cannot survive in acidic water. our two research questions are related to this concern. 
 
 * Does precipitation (rainy season) affect the pH level? (Acid rain? Water flowing from the street?)
 * Does precipitation affect water conductivity? (Pollution water flowing in?
 
To predict a good analysis using the given set of data, it is important to know which data affect the analysis. The below questions are of concern by the research team.
 
 * What factors affect the water quality the most (Solved using Multiple Regression approach)?
 * What models can we try to find the relationship between water quality and other parameters in the given dataset?
 * What parameters are dependent and which ones are independent?
 * Does time (HH:MM: SS) affect Float test 1 to float test 5?
 * Could you please clarify about the sites NEGP and WGP? What does it stand for and how water flows in these four sites north, west, NEGP, and WGP? 

The analysis can help to determine which people should be offered free land for cultivating. The decisions and actions that can be taken based on the analysis will help to determine how to optimize resource usage. To prevent from land and natural resources from contamination analysis will help to monitor lands and determine when and whom to offer. The analysis could help find out what are the factors which affect the amount of E.coli. Based on analytics and finding out the right combination can help us do better cultivating.  Finding water quality factors and other related parameters can help us give more information and help people do better cultivation.
The detailed study will help for future planning and find the best ways to get a better result from cultivation. There are a lot of factors which affect cultivation, the results and analysis can help to improve cultivation. The project focuses on using the available data and determines the factors which affect water and find out how to improve the current process.
